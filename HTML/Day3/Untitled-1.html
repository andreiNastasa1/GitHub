                <h3>Where to find video games</h3>
                <p>
                    The best place to find video games is on an application called
                    Steam. Steam is a video game distributor which sells all genres of
                    games from fighting and adventure to puzzle and simulators.

                <h3>I have games but no game</h3>
                <p>
                    One thing you might notice as you play more games is that you have
                    no life. You don't have friends let alone a girlfriend. How do you
                    get out of your cave as a gamer?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The simple answer is conventions! Gaming/Anime conventions happen
                    all the time in all parts of the world. Here's a video of some
                    cringe stuff you can do to appeal the masses (or more likely lose
                    all dignity).

                <h3>How can I find a convention?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can look for conventions online by just typing "gaming
                    convention" on Google. There are multiple websites centered around
                    gaming culture which frequently post about the latest conventions
                    that are happening.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Getting to the convention is a whole other story. You can use google
                    maps below to search where the convention you're looking for is.
                    Make sure to start preparing to go there multiple weeks in advance
                    and double or even triple check how you will get there and how you
                    will return to your cave.

                <p>
                    So you know how to play find games, and win at the game of life, but
                    something is missing. You only become a true gamer when you achieve
                    something.
                </p>

                <h4>Speedrunning</h4>
                <p>
                    What is speedrunning? Speedrunning is trying to complete a game as
                    fast as possible. The speedrunning scene is very competitive but if
                    you manage to get on the
                    <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/goiwbf">leaderboards</a>, you will
                    gain the atmost respect from all gamers. And that is how you become
                    a God Gamer.
